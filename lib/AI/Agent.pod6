=begin AI-Agent

=head1 Description

AI Agent contains a dispatch system from LISP which causes
Cognitive AI to occur (read: in LISP.)

The Agents have an Actor class which dispatches messages
to its clients.

The system can also be used for Actor-based OOP as everything
therein is a message dispatching system between objects.
